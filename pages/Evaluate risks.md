- Then we should also question the viability of each part we think we solved. We ask ourselves questions like:
	- Does this require new technical work we’ve never done before?
	- Are we making assumptions about how the parts fit together?
	- Are we assuming a design solution exists that we couldn’t come up with ourselves?
	- Is there a hard decision we should settle in advance so it doesn’t trip up the team?
- Declare out of bounds.
- Cut unnecessary parts.
- Present to technical experts.
